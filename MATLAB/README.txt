This folder contains MATLAB .m (code) and .mat (data) files related to the "Send-receive communication asymmetry in brain networks: Inferring directionality of neural signalling from undirected structural connectomes" manuscript. The code requires a recent (>2010) version of MATLAB and has been rested on version 2016a. Function to compute network communication measures can also be found as part of the Brain Connectivity Toolbox.
